# quiver

Quick interactive visualizations in R. Powered by D3, viewed in the browser.

This package currently includes three functions:

 - uhist(X) plots histograms, allowing the user to view one variable at a time from the provided data frame X.
 - mplot(X) produces scatterplots from the data frame X. The user can interactively select the x and y variables as well as variables for coloring the points or resizing the points.
 - iview(X) views the data frame X in a table with easy scrolling and sorting.
